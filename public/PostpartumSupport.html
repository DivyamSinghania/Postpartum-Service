                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Learn about the baby blues, postpartum depression, and anxiety:</strong> These emotional states are common after childbirth. Baby blues are short-term feelings of sadness, anxiety, or mood swings. Postpartum depression is more severe and long-lasting, requiring medical attention. Anxiety can manifest as excessive worry, fear, or panic attacks. Recognizing these conditions helps in seeking timely support.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recognizing when to seek professional help:</strong> It's crucial to understand when emotional struggles go beyond normal adjustment. Signs to watch for include persistent sadness, lack of interest in activities, feelings of hopelessness, or thoughts of self-harm. Seeking help from a healthcare provider can make a significant difference.</li>
                    <li><strong>Coping strategies to manage mood swings and emotional stress:</strong> Techniques such as mindfulness meditation, deep breathing exercises, journaling, and talking to a trusted friend can help manage stress. It's important to find what works best for you and integrate these strategies into your daily routine.</li>
